    <h1>Capstone Project Proposal</h1>
    <p>The topic I have decided to focus on is a positive future where the fears of artificial intelligence have diminished and it has blended into society. I think I will focus particularly on a target audience of artists and creatives because currently this realm is the most affected by AI creativity. I do not plan to work with a partner. My topic relies most on speculative design and challenging mental models. Some of the features I imagine the final product will include is a justification about not needing to fear AI by showing the introduction of past technologies and the initial fear they sparked, as well as how quickly that fear went away. A concern I have is that my idea is too factual, with little room for interactive elements.</p>
