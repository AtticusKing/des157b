            <ul>
                <li>Images and Visuals
                <p>Speaking to my user afterwards, I learned that the timeline could use better visuals. In her words,
                    "it would have been nice to see an image of each invention". For increased interactivity, I think it
                    would be good to add a button or hover attribute so that the user can pull up an image of each
                    invention if they desire or not. In the 'Forbes' article, it would also help break up the text by
                    adding images or graphs.</p>

                <li>Navigation Buttons
                <p>My usability tester found the site navigation to be somewhat clunky. After the test, she reported a
                    confusion with the coloring and effect of the back/forward arrows. Particularly, because they
                    weren't grayed out it seemed as if there was something to go to before she had even nagivated the
                    site. Also, at the bottom of the timeline it was inconvienent to have to scroll all the way back to
                    the top of the page after reading.</p>

                <li>Starting Point
                <p>After clicking through pages with information and stories, the Clock page was severely overwhelming.
                    My user said she would have liked to see it come first, in order to set the scene. Possibly, this
                    Clock page could be the Home page that users begin on. And on it, there would be buttons to the
                    other pages and maybe a description of the project.</p>
